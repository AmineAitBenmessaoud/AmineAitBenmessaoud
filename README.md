#  Hi, I'm Amine Ait Benmessaoud

##  Software Engineer | Aspiring Polymath

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a **software engineer**, a **builder of ideas**, and a lifelong learner passionate about **technology**, **mathematics**, and the **art of problem-solving**.

###  About Me

*  **Software Engineer** — Specialized in **backend engineering**, with professional experience in **Java**, **Spring**, **Spring Batch**, and large-scale information systems.
*  Passionate about **functional programming**, **mathematical modeling**, and **formal verification**. I regularly experiment with languages like **Haskell**, **Scala**, and **Agda**.
*  **Engineer with a math brain** — I love blending software with mathematics, whether it’s stochastic processes, machine learning, or logic proofs.
*  Currently preparing for coding interviews and exploring opportunities that combine **engineering, creativity, and impact.**
*  On a mission to **reignite my polymath mindset** — from software to physics, finance, philosophy, and beyond.

### ⚙ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Java, Python, Scala, Haskell, Agda, TypeScript
* **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Spring Batch, AngularJS
* **Tools & Platforms:** Kafka, Minio, Apache Spark, Syncsort, Docker, Git
* **Other:** Algorithm design, functional programming, formal methods, API development, distributed systems

###  Current Projects & Interests

* Building robust ETL pipelines using **Spring Batch** and distributed data processing with **Kafka** & **Spark**.
* Prototyping **hardware-software interfaces**, like heads-up display projection systems.
* Developing expertise in **functional programming** and **proof assistants** (Agda).

###  Learning Goals

* Advance my skills in **probabilistic models** and **algorithmic trading**.
* Deepen my understanding of **functional programming paradigms**.
* Master modern backend architectures, **distributed systems**, and **high-performance computing**.
* Continue developing my creativity in both technical and artistic fields.

###  Fun Facts

* Discovered coding in primary school and built my first website as a kid.
* Taught myself electronics during junior high and invented a novel electronic solution before turning 15.
* A firm believer that curiosity and grit are the ultimate accelerators.
* Fitness enthusiast: 🏋️‍♂ gym,  swimming, and  running keep me balanced.
* I’m driven by a simple goal: **to invent, to learn, and to build things that matter.**
